        <h2>About team</h2>
        <p>We chose these five exoplanets — Proxima b, Ross 128 b, HD 85512 b, Gliese 667Cc, and Kepler-186f — for good reason. Each of these planets plays an important role in studying and understanding space and has the potential to address several real-world issues. The project we are undertaking has several key objectives and brings significant benefits both to the scientific community and to the popularization of space research.
        </p>
        <p>The main goal of our project is to investigate potentially habitable exoplanets. There is a real problem in finding planets beyond Earth that could support life. The five planets we selected are located in the habitable zone of their stars, where the existence of liquid water is possible, which is a crucial factor for the development of life. We are creating a platform that systematizes and analyzes data about these planets to help scientists better understand which of them could become targets for future missions. In the context of climate change and resource depletion on Earth, the search for potentially habitable worlds becomes particularly relevant.
        </p>
        <p>Our project also helps to advance research in astrophysics. Each of these planets presents a unique interest to science. For example, Proxima b is the closest exoplanet to us, orbiting in the habitable zone of its star, while Kepler-186f is the first Earth-sized planet discovered in the habitable zone of another star. These planets allow scientists to explore the nature of planets beyond our solar system and deepen our understanding of the universe.
        </p>
        <p>One of the important aspects of our project is its educational component. We aim to raise awareness among the general public about space research and make complex scientific data more accessible to understanding. Through our website and project, we demonstrate why it is important to study exoplanets, how this can impact the future of humanity, and how such research can inspire future generations of scientists and researchers.</p>
